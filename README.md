Chapter 16 from TCR characterization book

/Users/schavan/Box/schavan/tcrdist3_run1

Chapter 16 has 3 examples

1. Example 1: Examining Epitope-Specific Paired αβ TCR Data <-- Almost done
2. Example 2: Finding Biochemically Similar TCRs in a Larger Set of Unannotated TCRs
3. Example 3: Comprehensive Analysis of Bulk Unannotated Data
I've used GLIPH2 before which is more sequence similarity-based only rather than biochemical similarity
